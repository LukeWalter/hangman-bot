# Hangman Bot

This bot plays a game of hangman with users that @mention it as a reply in a Twitter thread.

_Note 1: The bot will only work when the @mention is stated in a reply to a status that was not tweeted by @hang_man_bot.

_Note 2: You must be comfortable using your computer's command line interface to use this bot. If you've never used it, there are tutorials for [macOS](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) and [Windows](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-command-prompt-introduction/)._

## Installation

If you don't already have have them, please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). This will install two programs: `node`, which runs JavaScript from the command line, and `npm`, which helps you install software that Node.js can run.

Make an empty project directory somewhere convenient for you and clone this repository into that directory. Go to your project directory in the command line. Now type the following in the command line in your project directory:

`node bot.js`

If everything is set up correctly, the bot should activate. At this point, @mentioning it under the proper circumstances (@hang_man_bot) will begin a game.
